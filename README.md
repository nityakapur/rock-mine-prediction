## Project Summary 
The project focuses on detecting whether an object is a rock or mine after training the dataset through logistic regression. The highest accuracy is attained to be 85%. 

## Methodology

1. Leveraging pandas to load dataset
2. Processing dataset and splitting into testing and training set
3. Training through Logistic Regression
4. Calculating accuracy via testing dataset
5. Further testing the model to check predictions on random values
